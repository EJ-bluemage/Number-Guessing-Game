## Preface
The Number Guessing Game is a simple project that is created using java where you have to guess a random number from 1 to 100. The game has three varying difficulties: Easy (10 chances), Medium (5 chances), and Hard (3 chances). After your chances have been spent, the game will ask the user if they want to restart the game. Once they have chosen yes, it will take them back to the difficulty selection.
