## Preface
The Number Guessing Game is a simple project that is created using java where you have to guess a random number from 1 to 100. The game has three varying difficulties: Easy (10 chances), Medium (5 chances), and Hard (3 chances). After your chances have been spent, the game will ask you if you want to restart the game. Once you have chosen yes, it will take you back to the difficulty selection.
